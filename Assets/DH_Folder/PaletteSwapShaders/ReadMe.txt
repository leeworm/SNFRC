Thank You for Supporting Our Packages! This Shader is free to use in all types of projects including commercial, 
but I would appreciate attribution if you do make a game using this asset. (Preferably Milton Jones, Alternatively Void Forged Games)

To start using the Palette Swap Shader all you need to do is create a material and assign the appropriate shader from the Palette Swap menu in the shader select dropdown window.

The package includes shaders that support palettes up to 1024px wide, however it is recommended to use the smallest palette size that you are able to.

The Included demo scene has a showcase of some materials setup on a pixel art rocket and how they are affected by the 4bit palette Swap shader.

As you can see in the included demo the palette does not have to include all of the colors of the original sprite only the ones you wish to change. You will need an image that contains the colors you wish to change
as well as the colors you wish to change to.

In addition you can use this shader with ramp gradients instead of single pixel palettes, however the accuracy may vary. Higher bit versions of the shader will perform better when using ramp gradients.
